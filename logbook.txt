1. Eugloh summer school started
2. I received an email from lunarc people as follows for gpu problem:
	1) you cannot use "interactve" in a batch job
	2) there are 2 partiotions (queues) with gpus
	-p gpu
	-p gpuk20
	the first one is quite loaded so you must be prepared to wait.
	if you use the lu partition (-p lu) you will never get a gpu.
3. working on gpu problem solving in lunarc

Trying to solve gpu and torch.cuda problem in lunarc and kebnekaise (seems unsolvable :(()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
July 15, 16
I tried to run three different scripts on lunarc and make a connection to gpus

1) The first one was NER_by_Flair_NCBI.py
################################################
I tried the following job, first. However, It is still pending after 48 hours

****** The good news is after it started, it used gpus and it took only 00:59:22 minutes
to run while it took 13 hours on cpu.
In this case The devices was shown as
Device: cuda:0
It means that this if became true finally:

It is still pending after 48 hours.

and the following one also didn't work, although it started immediately for one hour.

###############################################################################
The second and third scripts were the following scripts and I got different errors for each of them.

2) /snic2020-6-41/salma-files/NLPProject/Flair/jobs/gpu-test.py
It is for testing numba which is a jit compiler but I was not successful.....
In the jupyter notebook snic2020-06-41/salma-files/NLPProject/Flair/Regex_cuda_test.ipynb I have some notes on numba and jit and.......




3) /snic2020-6-41/salma-files/ImageProject/Courses/FMAN45/L14_files/torch_mnist_cuda.py
I could run this on Marcus's system.
The code has the following part to copy the data on gpu:
# Load network and send to GPU
    c = ConvNet()
    print(summary(c, torch.zeros((1,1,28,28))))
    c.cuda()
*****I received the following error while I was trying to run it on cpu in lunarc
Found no NVIDIA driver on your system. Please check that you

And I am waiting for gpu results on lunarc




While I was trying to run NER_by_Flair_NCBI.py on marcus system I got the following error:

I am working on a tutorial for using kebnekaise and abisko
for log in, save files, submit a job and use gpus

It is stored as /snic2020-06-41/salma_files/Tutorials/kebnekaise_abisko_short_tutorial.ipynb
I also completed other tutorials and store them in the same directory as /snic2020-06-41/salma_files/Tutorials/
--------------------------------------------------------------------
July 22
submitting a job on cpu and also gpu works on kebnekaise and abisko now.
A copy of tutorial is sent to Malou.

For running our image processing scripts on kebnekaise we need the storage project,
since we have only 25GB of memory on /pfs/nobackup/ space. However, we have access to
large memry project on kebnekaise which provides us 3072000MB memory for our job.
""If your job requires more than 126000MB / node on Kebnekaise, there is a limited number of nodes with 3072000MB memory, which you may be allowed to use (you apply for it as a separate resource when you make your project proposal in SUPR). They are accessed by selecting the largemem partition of the cluster. You do this by setting: -p largemem.""
--------------------------------------------------------------------
July 23, 24
I make a run on gpu nodes of kebnekaise. I had some error yesterday for my scripts
as follows:

AssertionError:
The NVIDIA driver on your system is too old (found version 10010).
Please update your GPU driver by downloading and installing a new
version from the URL: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx
Alternatively, go to: https://pytorch.org to install
a PyTorch version that has been compiled with your version
of the CUDA driver.

I tried to change the version of pytorch(torch and torchvision) and then I got another error as:

/bin/bash: /hpc2n/eb/software/lmod/lmod/init/bash: Transport endpoint is not connected
python: error while loading shared libraries: libpython3.6m.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I emailed the problem to support people and I got this answer:
You should load the appropriate python in your submit file using the following
after the SBATCH commands and before actually using python, you can find the
available versions of python using ml spider python/
see the following for more information
https://www.hpc2n.umu.se/documentation/environment/lmod

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
July 27 (off day)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
July 28

I downgraded the version of torch and torchvision to be campatible with the NVIDIA driver version.

My previous version of torch was torch==1.5.1 and torchvision==0.6.0.

I had to reinstall them and install lower versions as (command="pip freeze"):
torch==1.3.0
torchvision==0.4.0

I also had to load "cuDNN" and "CUDA" modules. And for loading these modules I had to load their dependencies
which I can find out with "ml spider module_name".


Finally, I could run my "torch_mnist_cuda.py" script as a job on kebnekaise on K80 node without error in newEnv environment.

The list of modules I loaded were: (command== "ml")

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) systemdefault       (S)   7) GCC/8.3.0        13) libffi/3.2.1
  2) snicenvironment     (S)   8) ncurses/6.1      14) bzip2/1.0.8
  3) iccifort/2019.5.281       9) libreadline/8.0  15) SQLite/3.29.0
  4) GCCcore/8.3.0            10) Tcl/8.6.9        16) Python/3.7.4
  5) zlib/1.2.11              11) XZ/5.2.4         17) CUDA/10.1.243
  6) binutils/2.32            12) GMP/6.1.2        18) cuDNN/7.6.4.38


For training flair model on kebnekaise I submitted the job. However, I got this error:
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/home/s/salmak/.flair/embeddings/pubmed-2015-fw-lm.pt'

The steps:
ml GCCcore/8.3.0
ml Python/3.7.4
source /pfs/nobackup/$HOME/NLPenv/bin/activate

by running in terminal I got the memory error that quota exceeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
July 29, 30
I annotated images again to compare with Sonja's and Jon and Mariam annotations.

I assigned a number to each label and if I had the same label for each image, the numbers would sum up together..
I assign a column to each label and show the results in a table in
snic2020-6-41/salma-files/ImageProject/Game/Annotations/Annotation_comparison.ipynb

------------------------------------------------------------------------
July31
Iran shared images with us on lu box.
All images are transfered to lunarc and kebnekaise for some analysis.

I searched a little bit on a target journal for game manuscript.
I think bioinformatcs journal is good.

https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/pages/instructions_for_authors

working on Iran's images.
1) Read them and convert them to a numpy arrays categorized in two classes: Control, and lps
2) Cut images to (224,224) tiles to fed into a dense network.
3) The total images were 140 conrol images and 70 lps images.
4) Now, we have 2520 control tiles and 1820 lps images. the size of lps ones are different.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aug10

train a DenseNet with the images and test new data.
I can find the DenseNet paper from following link:


All the files are stored on snic2020-6-41/salma-files/ImageProject/Collabrations directory.

There are still some issues with the result.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aug11

Continue the analysis of iran images

Complete Annotation_comparison notebook and upload it to AitsLab/Microscopy_image_analysis_folder

Upload Tutorials directory to AitsLab/Infrastructure


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debugging analysis
train network over and over again

still bad test results
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sep 06

I trained a VGG16model + two different layers on top of that. All analysis is on snic2020-6-41/salma-files/ImageProject/Collabrations/
directory.
There are four jupyter notebooks that are summarized in one for sharing with Darsi group and will be presented on Sep 09 with them.
The main codes are in python-script/3_Sep_VGG_data_4 and python-script/3_Sep_VGG_batch_normalization_data_4 that is the final results on data_4 set.
In which 80 percent of original images are separated for training dataset and 10, 10 for validation and test. Then those images are cropped to smaller tiles (224,224).


I am trying to use gradcam to find the gradients of output loss with respect to the last conv layer to see the network is trained on what part of the image.
However, for the tensorflow version problem I got multiple error.
I had to create new conda environment as following:


conda create -n tfgpu tensorflow python=3.6.8

conda install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1

to test my code again. I am working on it to solve the errors.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sep 14

I am working on the LPS/Ctrl images. I am trying to work with original images. extract some images.
separate them in 80, 10, 10 ratio. Add blurred images with kernel size=3 and K=5 to the main data. Change the brighness of images randomly.
train the new network (VGG16) on them and check the result.

We have the  new storage project on kebnekaise.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Sep 16-17

I used pytorch for training the vgg16 classifiers on darcy' project and ran on marcus's system.
The results were not good enough. working on that....

Going to do:
Start Coursera NLP course
----------------------------------------------
May 24-29 
plan:
Finish histology runs and complete the manuscript
Finisg NLP course
----------------------------------------------
June 1-25
working 50 %
Working on histology project
Finding a bug in 5-fold dataset
slide 28 exists in both MV and Control and copied to both folds where MV was validation and where Control was validation by mistake
Correcting that

Filling the information in the manuscript
---------------------------------------------
June 29
*******making new environment
pip install opencv-python-headless
--------------------------------------------
Parental leave on July (alost 100 %)
-------------------------------------------
9th of July Group meeting
Results:
Salma:
	1. Histology
	2. Biobert project
Goals:
Train the large version on HunNer corpora
Save the model in .pb format for further predictions
Use clusters (Alvis)
Make it compatible with TF.02
Finish the manuscript 


Sonja:
Mariamâs project
Gene, symbols, identifier
To resolve them to a single 
Conversion tool, uniport has
Gene ids could be chosen but uniport (manually reviewed part and 
Another part automatically part (unreviewed part))
Some donât match (still updating)
Sonja Update Mariamâs code (pandas instead of for loops)
Theresa is doing master project in August

--------------------------------------------
Aug 03,
I realized I was not running my codes on gpus. There was this error that 
"Could not load dynamic library 'libcublas.so.10'; dlerror: libcublas.so.1.."

I did  ml CUDAcore/11.3.1

And It is solved. I also 
ml 2) cuDNN/8.2.1.32-CUDA-11.3.1   3) CUDA/10.1.243   4) CUDAcore/11.3.1
Now the code is running on gpu :)

------------------------------------------
Nov 01 2021
start working after Two month full leave
1. This week I will work on histology manuscript
2. I also try to run the biobert pytorch models on gold standard
(only for gene and protein)
3. Add my binary part to Iran's manuscript
-----------------------------------------
Nov02, 03, and 04 vab (Noura was at home)
I added all biobert results to NER_results excel sheet.

checking the data (Hunflair data and tokenization)

I have one from Adam-ola github page which is 
https://github.com/Aitslab/BioNLP/tree/master/Adam_Ola/ner_inputs/HunFlair_NER_gene/gene_all_combined/train_dev.tsv


And one from Marcus Klang as HUNER_DATASET.zip on 
ner_inputs directory 
----------------------------------------
Nov 08
-All the dates of folders are checked by stat command 
-All the reported results were done on Adam-ola dataset Added all to excel sheet

**Start to add Flair results

After this all the done tasks will shown by -
After this all the ongoing tasks will shown by **

-Updated logbook added to /salmaviolet/Microscopy_image_analysis_folder/ github repo
Following steps were done:
-git clone https://github.com/salmaviolet/Microscopy_image_analysis_folder.git
-git add logbook.txt
-git commit -m 'Update Nov 08'

then in Setting - developer setting - generate token - copy the token

-git push -u origin master or -git push
username: salmaviolet
paste: paste token

tips: For moving curser to the end of vim editor:
ESC   
then 
Shift + G
---------------------------------------
Nov 16
*Flair embeddings are not working
*The link is now
https://nlp.informatik.hu-berlin.de/resources/embeddings/flair/

-I had to download embedding files as *.pt and pass the path to FlairEmbeddings('.pt path') function.
---------------------------------------


Nov 17 -- Parental leave

 For using gpu in scripts
 add --gpus 4 (e.g.,)
 and also run this 
 
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch 
*****This did not work 
 
It is also possible to use gpu in front end interactive mode
interactive --gpus=1
*** This also worked


*****This did
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia



------------------------------------- 
 Nov 19
 work 50%
 Noura was sick
 Finish Flair evaluation on Gold standard
 
 train the model
 save the checkpoints
 load the checkpoints and resume the training
 add all the results to Excel sheet
 -------------------------------------
 Nov 22- Noura was sick
 -------------------------------------
 Nov 23- come back to office
 read Iran's manuscript
 Answer all comments
 -------------------------------------
 Nov 24-25
 I was sick
 -------------------------------------
 Nov 26
 Working on manuscript
 -------------------------------------
 Nov 29- Dec 03
 Oral communication course
 -------------------------------------
 Dec 06
 A little work on Kaggle new compettition data
 Being in contact with Malou
 She train U-Net on the data 15 epochs
 The results shows F1-score of 0.16 (the best score is around 0.339 now)
 write the manuscript
 -------------------------------------
Dec 07
-Still on Kaggle data

* I will write the binary part of histology manuscript today
--------------------------------------
Dec 08
For creating Malou's environment

First need to 
conda update --all 
conda env export --no-builds > env.yml 
conda env create -f env.yml
- also need to change the name of env in env.yml
